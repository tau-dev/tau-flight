*This is the source code of [my WASM4 jam entry](https://tau-dev.itch.io/taufl1) from some time ago. It's a neat little software renderer, but the code is very unoptimized and has lots of game-jam sloppiness.*

# Tá´€á´œ Flight Simulator 1.0

A flight sim game for the [WASM-4](https://wasm4.org) fantasy console.

The aerodynamic model is physically-based, but the plane
parameters do not correspond to any particular real-world plane.

The renderer is very CPU-intensive; you will probably want to run this
game on a decent desktop PC with Firefox or Chromium.

## CONTROLS

Gamepad 2 (ðŸ„´/ðŸ„³, ðŸ…‚/ðŸ„µ): Pitch, Roll

Gamepad 1 (â­  / â­¢, â­¡ / â­£ ): Yaw, Throttle

Hold â­£ at zero throttle to extend flaps and brake.

Trigger 1 (ðŸ…‡) to toggle the altimeter between ground (HGT) and sea level (ALT).

Hold Trigger 2 (ðŸ…‰ or ðŸ„²) to trim the controls, Trigger 1 and Trigger 2 to reset the trim.

## HINTS

The controls are pretty hard to master; very small movements often suffice.

For the first mission, you only need to reach the runway; after that, you will have to land gracefully.

Shake off missiles by flying very close to the ground until they crash.


Good luck, pilot.
