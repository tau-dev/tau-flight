# Tá´€á´œ Flight Simulator 1.0

A flight sim game for the [WASM-4](https://wasm4.org) fantasy console.

The aerodynamic model is physically-based, but the plane
parameters do not correspond to any particular real-world plane.

The renderer is very CPU-intensive; you will probably want to run this
game on a desktop PC in Firefox or Chromium.

## CONTROLS

Gamepad 2 (ðŸ„´/ðŸ„³, ðŸ…‚/ðŸ„µ): Pitch, Roll

Gamepad 1 (â­  / â­¢, â­¡ / â­£): Yaw, Throttle

Hold â­£ on the ground to brake.

Hold Trigger 1 (ðŸ…‡) to trim the controls.

Good luck, pilot!
