# Tᴀᴜ Flight Simulator 1.0

A flight sim game for the [WASM-4](https://wasm4.org) fantasy console.

The aerodynamic model is physically-based, but the plane
parameters do not correspond to any particular real-world plane.

The renderer is very CPU-intensive; you will probably want to run this
game on a decent desktop PC with Firefox or Chromium.

## CONTROLS

Gamepad 2 (🄴/🄳, 🅂/🄵): Pitch, Roll

Gamepad 1 (⭠ / ⭢, ⭡ / ⭣ ): Yaw, Throttle

Hold ⭣ at zero throttle to extend flaps and brake.

Trigger 1 (🅇) to toggle the altimeter between ground (HGT) and sea level (ALT).

Hold Trigger 2 (🅉 or 🄲) to trim the controls, Trigger 1 and Trigger 2 to reset the trim.

## HINTS

The controls are pretty hard to master. I won't judge you for quicksaving (WASM4 menu: ⏎).

Shake off missiles by flying very close to the ground until they crash.

Good luck, pilot.
